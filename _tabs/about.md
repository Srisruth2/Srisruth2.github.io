# Hello!


 I'm Srisruth Karanam, a sophomore majoring in Computer Science at Michigan State University. My passion for science and mathematics has been a driving force throughout my academic journey, guiding me towards the fascinating world of computer science.

Ever since I was young, I've been captivated by the logic and problem-solving aspects of math and science. This interest naturally evolved into a love for coding and technology, where I find immense joy in creating innovative solutions and exploring the endless possibilities within the digital realm.

At Michigan State University, I'm actively engaged in various projects and coursework that challenge me to think critically and creatively. I enjoy collaborating with peers and professors, learning from their experiences, and contributing to the vibrant tech community on campus.

When I'm not immersed in coding or solving mathematical problems, you can find me exploring new scientific concepts, reading up on the latest tech advancements, or participating in science and math-related clubs and events. I'm always eager to learn and grow, both personally and academically, and I'm excited about the future opportunities that lie ahead in the field of computer science.
