# Game Dev 
## Samurai Showdown: Shadows of the Shogun

### Samurai Showdown: 
Shadows of the Shogun is an action-packed game developed using the Pygame library. The game showcases a variety of technical features and innovations:

### Sprite Animations:
 The game utilizes multiple sprite sheets to create smooth and dynamic animations for the samurai character and enemies. Each action, such as walking, attacking, and blocking, is represented by a distinct set of sprites to enhance visual fluidity.

### Block and Attack Mechanism:
 Implemented a block attack system allowing the player to perform defensive maneuvers. The player can block incoming attacks using a specific keypress, which triggers the blocking animation and reduces or negates damage from enemies.

### Collision Detection:
 Robust collision detection algorithms are in place to manage interactions between the player, enemies, and the environment. This ensures accurate hit detection during combat and proper character movements within the game world.


# Genetic algorithm Word guesser
### Project Description

This project implements a genetic algorithm to guess a sentence provided by the user. The program evolves a population of random sentences over several generations, aiming to produce a sentence that matches the user's input. The main components and functions of the algorithm are detailed below:

#### Functions:

1. **`fitness(target, individual)`**:
   - **Purpose**: Evaluates the similarity between an individual and the target sentence.
   - **Algorithm**: Compares each character of the individual with the corresponding character in the target. The fitness score is calculated as the number of matching characters divided by the length of the target.

2. **`five_tournament_selection(population, target)`**:
   - **Purpose**: Selects the best individuals from the population for crossover.
   - **Algorithm**: Randomly selects five individuals from the population and returns the one with the highest fitness score.

3. **`make_population(target)`**:
   - **Purpose**: Generates an initial population of random sentences.
   - **Algorithm**: Creates a string of random characters from a predefined alphabet. The total length of the population is the length of the target sentence multiplied by the population size.

4. **`mutation(individual)`**:
   - **Purpose**: Mutates an individual by randomly changing its characters.
   - **Algorithm**: Each character in the individual has a probability of being replaced by a random character from the alphabet.

5. **`single_point_crossover(individual1, individual2)`**:
   - **Purpose**: Combines parts of two individuals to create new offspring.
   - **Algorithm**: Randomly selects a crossover point and swaps the segments of the two individuals beyond that point.

6. **`find_best_individual(population, target)`**:
   - **Purpose**: Identifies the best matching individual in the population.
   - **Algorithm**: Iterates through the population, calculating the fitness of each individual, and returns the one with the highest fitness score.

#### Main Loop:

The `main` function orchestrates the genetic algorithm:

1. **Initialization**:
   - Displays a welcome banner.
   - Prompts the user to input a target sentence.

2. **Input Validation**:
   - Checks if the input contains only valid characters from the predefined alphabet.

3. **Population Generation**:
   - Generates an initial population of random sentences using `make_population`.

4. **Generational Evolution**:
   - Iterates through a predefined number of generations, applying selection, mutation, and crossover to evolve the population:
     - **Selection**: Uses `five_tournament_selection` to pick the best individuals.
     - **Mutation**: Applies random changes to the selected individuals using `mutation`.
     - **Crossover**: Combines selected individuals to create new offspring using `single_point_crossover`.

5. **Fitness Evaluation**:
   - Evaluates the fitness of each individual and updates the population with the best matches.
   - If a perfect match is found, the algorithm terminates early.

6. **Final Output**:
   - If no perfect match is found after all generations, the best individual from the final generation is displayed.
   - Prompts the user to continue or exit the program.

This structured approach allows the genetic algorithm to iteratively improve the population's fitness, aiming to guess the target sentence accurately.

# Cross-Word 
###  Project Description
This project is a console-based crossword puzzle game implemented in Python, utilizing the Crossword and Clue classes to manage the puzzle structure and gameplay. The game allows users to load a crossword puzzle from a file, display clues, make guesses, reveal answers, and get hints. The main loop of the program facilitates user interaction by processing various commands to manipulate and solve the puzzle. Users can display a specified number of clues, make guesses for specific clues, reveal answers, and get hints for incorrect letters. The game also supports restarting and quitting, providing a comprehensive crossword puzzle experience in a text-based interface.



# Automatic-Backup-Python-Script 
### Project Description: 
Python Backup Script
This Python script automates the process of backing up files and folders from a specified directory to a designated backup location. Developed by "srisruth," the script provides a straightforward yet powerful solution for safeguarding data against loss or corruption. Here's an overview of its functionalities:

#### Backup Initialization:

Users initiate the backup process by providing two directory paths: the source directory containing files to be backed up and the destination directory where backups will be stored. The script prompts users to input these paths via the console interface.

#### File Backup:

Upon validation of the source directory, the script iterates through its contents, identifying files eligible for backup. Each file is selectively copied to the specified backup directory using Python's shutil.copy2() function. If the backup directory doesn't exist, the script creates it automatically.

#### Folder Backup:

In addition to individual files, the script supports backing up entire folders. It traverses the source directory recursively, identifying and copying each subdirectory and its contents to the designated backup location using shutil.copytree().

#### Error Handling and Feedback:

The script incorporates error handling mechanisms to manage scenarios such as invalid directory paths or failed file operations gracefully. Informative messages are displayed to users, detailing the status of each backup operation and any encountered issues.

#### Post-Backup Actions:

After completing the backup process, the script offers users the option to open the backup destination folder using the os.startfile() function. This feature enhances user convenience by allowing immediate verification and access to the backed-up data.
